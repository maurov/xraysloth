Sloth: slowly evolving utilities for X-ray spectroscopists
==========================================================

Sloth is a Python library oriented to X-ray instrumentation/optics and data
reduction/analysis for X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS, XANES/EXAFS), X-ray
emission spectrocopy (XES) and Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS)
techniques.

**WARNING** In the current status, the library is not stable enough to be used in production environments. It performs as a partial random snapshot of daily
research in X-ray instrumentation and still-to-implement ideas (mainly
due to lack of time). Feel free to use/hack it and do not hesitate
to drop me a line if you find them useful. Furthermore, I appreciate if you could report bugs, enhancements or comments directly in `Github Issues
<https://github.com/maurov/xraysloth/issues>`_
