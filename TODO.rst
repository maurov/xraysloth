To Do
=====

A list of tasks that should be implemented and come up to my mind
while coding. Everything is collected in a single file instead of
dispersing *TODO* tags in the code. Another approach is to create
issues and self-assign them, but it is definitively overkill.

New features
------------

Here well defined tasks ready for implementation, grouped by
modules. No particular priority order is given.

* :mod:`sloth.utils.xdata`

  * make a single API for both `xraylib` and `larch` backends.


* :mod:`sloth.gui.sloth_main`

  * load data workflow.
  * 2D plots
  * Rowland circle
  * ...
  
Refactoring
-----------

* :mod:`sloth.raytracing`

  * revise the whole thing... currently a mess!
